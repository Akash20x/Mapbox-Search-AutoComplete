This will give 5 suggestions of places based on your input and display location with marker on mapbox maps.

I just tried to implement the feature shown in Local search with the Geocoding API in mapbox docs. 
But the problem their is search is included inside maps only and can't be used outside the map 
but through this we can also use selected place name outside maps. 
For example we store the place name in our database.
